## Data Sources

**API Endpoint**: https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2
**Data Updates**: Monday through Friday (excluding federal holidays)
**Coverage**: 400,000+ studies from 220+ countries
**Data Quality**: Official FDA/NIH registry with verified information

## Troubleshooting

1. **Server Connection Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Test server manually
   cd clinical-trials-server
   node build/index.js
   # Should show: "Clinical Trials MCP server running on stdio"
   ```

2. **Invalid NCT ID Errors**:
   - Ensure NCT IDs follow format: NCT########
   - Example: NCT05882279 ✓, nct123 ✗

3. **No Results Returned**:
   - Check search criteria - try broader terms
   - Some filters may be too restrictive
   - Verify spelling of conditions and interventions

4. **Timeout Issues**:
   - Server has 30-second timeout protection
   - Large result sets may take time to process
   - Reduce pageSize for faster responses

## Clinical Research Use Cases

- **Patient Recruitment**: Find actively recruiting trials for specific conditions
- **Competitive Analysis**: Research similar studies by sponsors or interventions  
- **Site Selection**: Identify optimal locations for new studies
- **Regulatory Research**: Access FDA-approved study protocols and outcomes
- **Academic Research**: Analyze clinical trial trends and statistics
- **Patient Care**: Help patients find appropriate treatment options
